## Should my dealer be collecting a down payment?
$1000 down seemed to be common in 2022. 

With no downpayment, there is room for a dealer to try to mess with your order,
markup the price, etc.. This is NOT common. Ford is cracking down on
dealers who try that. Post on [Ford Transit USA Forum](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com)
if this is happening to you.

## Why does my dealer need my license?
Other than Fleet orders (Amazon, etc..) Ford is currently only building custom
orders. No dealears are getting Transits unless they are sold to a customer.
Your license is how Ford is preventing the dealers from cheating.

## How come my dealer has a Transit for sale?
Most likely a customer bailed on their order for some reason or they cheated.

## Why did the price go up between when I ordered and I got my VIN?
Until you are issued a VIN, pricing is not locked in.

## Can I change my options once I've place my order?
Yes, if you do not have a VIN. But, changing your order can trigger other events like an increase
in price.

## Why did somoneone who ordered after me get their VIN or Vehicle before me?
Build order is not exclusively by the date you ordered. Build order is based on the complicated
relationship not only of parts availability for different options, but also delivery
slots to ship you van to your dealer and a bit of random luck.

## How are orders scheduled?
Each Thursday, Ford scans the open orders to evaluate them against the forecast for parts, build slots
at the plant, delivery slots, etc.. "Scheduled for Production' emails usually go out Thursday or Friday.
