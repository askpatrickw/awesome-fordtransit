# Contributing

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

We accept contributions via GitHub Issues only. The list is generated from structured data and maintained by automation; proposing changes through Issues keeps everything consistent and easier to review.

## Add a new resource (Issues only)

Use our issue template to suggest a new link/resource:

- [New resource template](https://github.com/askpatrickw/awesome-fordtransit/issues/new?template=NEW-LINK.yml)

What to include in the issue:

- URL to the Transit-specific page (use the site’s search if needed to deep-link).
- Optional: Check the “Use AI to generate description and category” box in the form.
- Optional: Your own description and/or category if you want to override the AI suggestion.

What happens next:

- A maintainer will review and validate the submission (and AI suggestions if selected).
- If accepted, we’ll add it to our data source and the README will be updated automatically by our workflows.

## Request a change or report a problem

Open an Issue for:

- Updating or removing an existing entry
- Category suggestions
- Broken links or other problems

Start here: [Issue choices](https://github.com/askpatrickw/awesome-fordtransit/issues/new/choose)

## Why we don’t accept PRs

- The README is generated from structured data (e.g., resources.json) using scripts and workflows.
- Direct edits via PRs would be overwritten and are harder to validate.
- Issues provide a clear, structured review process and keep automation happy.

## Thanks
